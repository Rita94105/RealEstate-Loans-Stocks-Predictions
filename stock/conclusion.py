         This suggests that simpler architectures may be more suitable for this 1000-day stock dataset. 
         However, the consistent underfitting across all models indicates potential issues with model complexity, data preprocessing, or hyperparameter tuning. 
         Future improvements could involve adjusting model architectures, increasing data diversity, or refining training strategies to better capture stock market trends.''')
